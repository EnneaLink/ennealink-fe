### Using App
When a user first opens the app, they must create unique username and a password. Once they do that, they must select and save their Enneagram and MBTI types via dropdowns to create their profile. If the user does not yet know their types, there are links to take the respective tests that open in new tabs.

Once their types are selected, the user is directed to their profile, where they can access a summary of each of their types, as well as external links to read more.

To add friends to follow, the user must click "friends" in the navigation bar, which takes them to a live search of all users. If they click a username, they are directed to that user's profile, where they can read about that user's types.

To follow that friend, the user can click the "follow" bottom on the bottom of the friend's profile. Once the friend is created, the friend will be viewable on the "friends" page, easily accessible at any time, with their types right next to their username on the link. As with search, the user just needs to click the friend's name to view their friend's profile. To remove a friend, just click "unfollow" at the bottom of the friend's profile.
